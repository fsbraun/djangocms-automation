djangocms-automation
====================

This package extends django CMS with the ability to model and edit automation workflows directly in the Frontend Editor (inline editing). Workflows are composed from CMS plugins (e.g., Triggers, Conditions/If‑Then‑Else, Actions, End) and can be arranged on the page via drag & drop like regular content.

Overview
- Frontend Editor: Edit workflows right on the page — no separate admin UI required.
- Building blocks as plugins: Trigger, If/Then/Else, Action, and End are available as dedicated plugins.
- Templates & assets: Project templates live under `templates/djangocms_automation/...` and static assets under `static/...`.

Quick start
- Install the app, add it to `INSTALLED_APPS`, and run migrations.
- Create automations from the admin, view and edit it using django CMS' frontend editor.
- Add the required building blocks (Trigger, If/Then/Else, Action, End) in the Frontend Editor and configure them.
